# ALX Student Project

Welcome to the ALX Student Fix My Code Challenge project! This project, part of ALX's curriculum, offers students a unique opportunity to debug existing code across various programming languages and paradigms. Whether you're an experienced developer looking to hone your debugging skills or a beginner eager to learn, this project provides an engaging way to improve your coding abilities.

## Overview

In the ALX Student Fix My Code Challenge, you'll be tasked with identifying and correcting issues in pre-existing code snippets. The challenges cover a range of programming languages and concepts, offering a diverse learning experience. By participating in this project, you'll strengthen your problem-solving skills, deepen your understanding of programming languages, and gain valuable experience in debugging techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each focusing on a specific coding problem. You'll find the following tasks within the project directory:

1. **FizzBuzz**: Correct an implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem in Python.
2. **Print Square**: Fix code written in JavaScript to print a square of a given size.
3. **Sort**: Debug a Ruby script to properly sort integer arguments.
4. **User Password**: Identify and rectify issues in a Python class related to password validation.
5. **Double Linked List**: Debug a C implementation of a double linked list.

Each task includes detailed instructions and the corresponding code files that need fixing.

## Getting Started

To begin fixing the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the task you want to work on.
3. Open the relevant code file in your preferred text editor.
4. Identify and correct any issues in the code.
5. Test your changes to ensure they produce the expected results.
